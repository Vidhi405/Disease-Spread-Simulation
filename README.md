This is the first project i have ever made, so i have taken help from generative AIs like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. I have understood the concepts, and needed a little bit of help with coding. I am still a beginner, but my love for technology, computer engineering and coding wont subside. It will forever grow.


# How I got this idea?
The most recent pandemic, the COVID-19, was a devastating disaster which destroyed several families. The spread of the disease was pretty fascinating so I wanted to simulate how diseases like COVID-19 or Influenza spread from one person/host to another person/host.


### Okay, too much about my story, now let's get into my project.

# Disease Spead Simulation

This is a simple simulation that shows how a disease may spread from one host to another using a grid-based approach.

## Features
- Simulates spread over a 2D grid
- Models susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals
- Visualizes infection growth over time
- Includes policy toggles: masking and social distancing

## How to run

'''bash

python3 main.py
